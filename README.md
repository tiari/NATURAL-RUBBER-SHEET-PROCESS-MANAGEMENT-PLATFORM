# NATURAL-RUBBER-SHEET-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT-PLATFORM
After harvesting of natural rubber latex (liquid form), it goes through different processess and turned into solid sheet form; this solid form if sold to industries for production of rubber goods. The processing of sheet rubber consists of different stages such as- latex quality determination, ageing of latex, coagualtion of latex, sheet rolling, sheet drying and sheet grading. IoT devices for each of the stages of sheet rubber processing will make the process transparent and more economic. Data analytic of the processess will enhance the decesion making capacities in process and any process error can be easily detected. Thus the complete sheet rubber processing chain will become more effective.
